        <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
        <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.</p>
        
        <h3>JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted</h3>
        <p>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</p>
        
        <p id="demo"></p>
        
        <h3>Declare Your Variables At the Top !</h3>
        
        <p>Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.  If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).</p>
        <p>To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope. Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule. </p>
        
        <script>
            var x = 5;  // Initialize x

            elem = document.getElementById("demo");             // Find an element 
            elem.innerHTML = "x is " + x + " and y is " + y;    // Display x and y

            var y = 7;  // Initialize y
