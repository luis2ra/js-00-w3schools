        <h2>JavaScript Use Strict</h2>
        <p><b>&quot;use strict&quot;;</b> Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in &quot;strict mode&quot;.</p>
        
        <h3>The "use strict" Directive</h3>
        <p>The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).</p>
        <p>It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript. </p>
        <p>The purpose of &quot;use strict&quot; is to indicate that the code should be executed in &quot;strict mode&quot;.</p>
        <p>With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.</p>
        
        <p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>
        
        <h3>Not Allowed in Strict Mode</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</li>

            <li>Writing to a get-only property is not allowed.</li>
