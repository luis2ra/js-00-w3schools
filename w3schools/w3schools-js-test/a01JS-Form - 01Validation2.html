        <h3>Automatic HTML Form Validation</h3>
        
        <p>HTML form validation can be performed automatically by the browser:</p>
        
        <p>If a form field (fname) is empty, the <b>required attribute</b> prevents this form from being submitted: </p>
        
        <form action="/action_page.php" method="post">
            <input type="text" name="fname" required>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
        
        <p>If you click submit, without filling out the text field, your browser will display an error message.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Validation</h3>
        <p>Data validation is the process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful.</p>
        <p>Typical validation tasks are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>has the user filled in all required fields?</li>
            <li>has the user entered a valid date?</li>
            <li>has the user entered text in a numeric field?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct user input.</p>
        <p>Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.</p>
        <p><b>Server side</b> validation is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.</p>
        <p><b>Client side</b> validation is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.</p>
        
        <h3>HTML Constraint Validation</h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduced a new HTML validation concept called constraint validation.</p>
        <p>HTML constraint validation is based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constraint validation <b>HTML Input Attributes</b></li>
            <li>Constraint validation <b>CSS Pseudo Selectors</b></li>
            <li>Constraint validation <b>DOM Properties and Methods</b></li>
        </ul>
