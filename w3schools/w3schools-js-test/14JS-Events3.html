        <h2>JavaScript Events</h2>
        
        <p>JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions:</p>
        
        <p>Click the button to display the date.</p>

        <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

        <p id="demo" style="background-color:Orange;"></p>
        
        <pre>
        What can JavaScript Do?

        Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:

            * Things that should be done every time a page loads
            * Things that should be done when the page is closed
            * Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
            * Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
            * And more ...

        Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

            * HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
            * HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
            * You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
            * You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
            * And more ...        
        </pre>
        
        <script>
            function displayDate() {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
            }
        </script>
